# Youtube-Scraper-For-Any-Channel
This particular scraper is used to pull video data like views, uploaded date, title, description, number of likes from the Youtube channel "Soch" but it will work for any channel.

It contains two different functions: basic and advanced.
Basic: Use the basic one to quickly pull video title, views and when the video was uploaded relative to today. (For ex: "3 months ago" or "1 year ago")

Advanced: The advanced once will get you all the publicly available data for the video including views, exact upload date, title, description, number of likes.
Note: The advanced scraper will open each video in a new tab to get that information and then close that tab so depending on the number of videos, it might take a while. 
On my computer, it took about 6.5 seconds per video so you have a rough estimate.
